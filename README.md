iNZight as a whole is a simple data analysis system which encourages exploring what data is saying without the distractions of driving complex software. While it was initially designed for New Zealand high schools, iNZight now extends to multivariable graphics, time series and linear models.

The `R` package that can be found here represents the graphical user interace (GUI) of the system and at least the accompanying packages `iNZightPlots` and `iNZightTools` are necessary to make use of this GUI. Further packages such as `iNZightRegression`, `iNZightTS` and `iNZightMR` exist to provide additional functionality. 


Installation
=======

The easiest way to install `iNZight` is through the standalone version that can be found on the official website https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/iNZight/index.html. 

The more experienced `R` user may want to install `iNZight` as an `R` package. This way `iNZight` can readily be updated through github without having to wait for an official release. Additional features and bugfixes will appear in this github repository first before they are incorporated into the standalone version.
